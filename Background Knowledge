# Project Outline: Causal Inference using Causal Trees in R

# Step 1: Install and Load Required Packages
# - Install and load the 'grf' package for causal inference
# - Load additional packages as needed (e.g., 'dplyr' for data manipulation)

# Step 2: Load and Prepare the Dataset
# - Load the dataset containing participant information
# - Perform any necessary data preprocessing and cleaning

# Step 3: Modeling with Causal Trees
# - Define treatment (X) and outcome (Y) variables
# - Create a data matrix with relevant predictor variables
# - Train a causal forest model using the 'causal_forest' function

# Step 4: Interpreting the Results
# - Print the causal tree to understand the estimated treatment effects
# - Analyze the tree's structure and its implications

# Step 5: Calculating Percent Causality
# - Calculate the average treatment effect (ATE) of a variable on the outcome
# - Calculate the percent causality by comparing ATE with relevant measures

# Step 6: Interpretation and Discussion
# - Discuss the findings in the context of your research question
# - Address assumptions and limitations of the causal inference approach

# Step 7: Conclusion and Future Work
# - Summarize the results and their implications
# - Suggest potential avenues for further research and exploration
